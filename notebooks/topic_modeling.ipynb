       "'This is a very rare combination anyone will explain in detail to use **Maven**, **Struts2**, **Hibernate** and maven Archetype as **maven\\\\-archetype\\\\-webapp** to create a end to end application.\\n\\nIn this blog, I attempted to explain each step of creating a Maven\\\\-based Struts 2 \\\\+ Hibernate application. It was a time\\\\-consuming task, but at the end of the day, it was completed and delivered successfully.\\n\\nLets start our journey to go through and learn complete implementation.\\n\\nWe are going to use Eclipse as an editor to develop Maven \\\\+ Struts2 \\\\+ Hibernate application.\\n\\nFollow below steps to create our very first Struts application project.\\n\\n1. Open Eclipse.\\n2. Click on **File** in top navigation menu and than click on **new**. There will be an option **Maven Project** start coming. Select **Maven Project** will take you to the below screen**.**\\n\\nDo not make any change and click on **Next**.\\n\\nZoom image will be displayed![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*wSPRsJ2rpxANxO8yFQGQfg.png)3\\\\. In the filter section type **maven\\\\-archetype\\\\-webapp** will give you list of options to select.\\n\\nSelect below below second highlighted option red in color and click on **Next**.\\n\\nZoom image will be displayed![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*MDqSzx-kDXNdnQnZ16Slvg.png)4\\\\.

It will create below folder structure\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:806/1*scYwUIR7qHtYYiLbqJby0A.png)6\\\\. Open **pom.xml** and place below highlighted dependency red in color.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1384/1*6vD4W06bAaXSXVyu8w1uuQ.png)\\n\\nHibernate Implementation\\n========================\\n\\n7\\\\. Lets configure Hibernate first in the project. Inside src we have main folder. Right click on the main folder and create one **Java** folder as shown below highlighted red in color.\\n\\nIt will also create a folder hierarchy highlighted green in color.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:666/1*9U82idEwUyWQWBmWkQ_kbA.png)8\\\\. Right click on the folder highlighted green in color in previous step and create package with name **com.javadoubts.PractiseHibernate**\\n\\nIn the same package create **User.java** class with below content.\\n\\nZoom image will be displayed![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*NkEhLaRHQt897iWzn5mRZA.png)9\\\\.
